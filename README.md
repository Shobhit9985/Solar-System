# SOLAR SYSTEM SIMULATOR PROJECT

## This Group Project aimed to visualize Solar System using java3D, project is interactive, realistic, and creative!

# Features
* Explore our solar system in 3D
* Observe the rotation and revolution of the planets and moons
* Learn about each planet's characteristics and other celestial bodies
* Control Revolution and Rotation of the planets using keyboard and mouse interaction
* Planets give out sounds on keyboard press
* Key Y - Stop/resume Revoltion of Mercury
* Key V - Stop/resume Revoltion of Venus
* Key E - Stop/resume Revoltion of Earth
* Key M - Stop/resume Revoltion of Mars
* Key J - Stop/resume Revoltion of Jupiter
* Key S - Stop/resume Revoltion of Saturn
* Key U - Stop/resume Revoltion of Uranus
* Key N - Stop/resume Revoltion of Neptune
* Key P - Stop/resume Revoltion of Pluto
* Key 1 - Stop/resume Rotation of Mercury
* Key 2 - Stop/resume Rotation of Venus
* Key 3 - Stop/resume Rotation of Earth
* Key 4 - Stop/resume Rotation of Mars
* Key 5 - Stop/resume Rotation of Jupiter
* Key 6 - Stop/resume Rotation of Saturn
* Key 7 - Stop/resume Rotation of Uranus
* Key 8 - Stop/resume Rotation of Neptune
* Key 9 - Stop/resume Rotation of Pluto
* Mouse clicking on meteors under the string for each planet will stop/resume rotation and/or revolution of the planet
* User-controlled SpaceShuttle that will collide with the meteor and cause explosion
* Multi- viewer screen
    1- Observable stationary universe(overrhead view )
    2- The spaceshuttle's navigation
    3- Movable universe to view from every perspective
    
# How to run this project
* Download and confige your runtime environment properly as instructed in Brightspace -> 2800 -> Resources -> How to install Java3D
* Download project zip file and attract it
* Check for correct path to resources in all files. (Using Ctrl + F might speed up this process)
Example: load_Object() might need "C:\Users\SolarSystem\..." rather than "\SolarSystem\..."
* In project directory -> solar package -> Assignment3KS.java -> 
run (For IDE integrated with run button) or if you uses commond prompt, please complie all *.java file first by "javac *.java" then "java Assignment3KS"

## Some common execution error (wrong setting up for projects)
* "Can not load main" : Properties of Project -> Java Compile -> uncheck use "--release" option
